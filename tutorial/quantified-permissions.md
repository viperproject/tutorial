# Quantified Permissions #

Viper provides two main mechanisms for specifying permission to a (potentially unbounded) number of heap locations: recursive [predicates](#predicates) and *quantified permissions*. While predicates can be a natural choice for modelling entire data structures which are traversed in an orderly top-down fashion, quantified permissions enable point-wise specifications, suitable for modelling heap structures which can be traversed in multiple directions, random-access data structures such as arrays, and unordered data structures such as general graphs.

The basic idea is to allow resource assertions such as `acc(e.f)` to occur within the body of a `forall` quantifier. In particular, the `e` receiver expression can be parameterised by the quantified variable, specifying permission to a *set* of different heap locations: one for each instantiation of the quantifier.

As a simple example, we can model a "binary graph" (in which each node has at most two outgoing edges) in the heap, in terms of a set of `nodes`, using the following quantified permission assertion: `forall n:Ref :: { n.first }{ n.second } n in nodes ==> acc(n.first) && acc(n.second)`. Such an assertion provides permission to access the `first` and `second` fields of all nodes `n` (as explained in the [previous section on quantifiers](#quantifiers), the `{ n.first }{ n.second }` syntax denotes triggers). To usefully model a graph, one would typically also require the `nodes` set to be closed under the graph edges, so that a traversal is known to stay within these permissions; this is illustrated in the following example:

```silver-runnable
field first : Ref
field second : Ref

method inc(nodes: Set[Ref], x: Ref)
  requires forall n:Ref :: { n.first } n in nodes ==> 
    acc(n.first) && 
    (n.first != null ==> n.first in nodes)
  requires forall n:Ref :: { n.second } n in nodes ==> 
    acc(n.second) && 
    (n.second != null ==> n.second in nodes)
  requires x in nodes
{
  var y : Ref
  if(x.second != null) {
    y := x.second.first // permissions covered by preconditions
  }
}
```

//exercise//

* Remove the second conjunct from the first precondition. The example should still verify. Now change the field access in the method body to be `x.first.first`. The example will no longer verify, unless you restore the original precondition.
* Try instead making the first precondition `requires forall n:Ref :: n in nodes ==> acc(n.first) && n.first in nodes`. The example should verify. Try adding an assert statement immediately after the assignment: `assert y != null`. This should verify - the modified precondition implicitly guarantees that `n.first` is always non-null (for any `n` in `nodes`), since it provides us with permission to a field of `n.first`.
* Try restoring the original precondition: `requires forall n:Ref :: n in nodes ==> acc(n.first) && (n.first != null ==> n.first in nodes)`. The `assert` statement that you added in the previous point should no-longer verify, since there is no-longer any reason that `n.first` is guaranteed to be non-null.

## Receiver Expressions and Injectivity ##

In the above examples, the receiver expressions used to specify permissions (the `e` expression in `acc(e.f)`) were always the quantified variable itself. This is not a requirement; for example, in the following code, quantified permissions are used along with a function `address` in the `exhale` statement, to exhale permission to multiple field locations:

```silver-runnable
field val: Int

function address(i: Int): Ref
//   ensures inverse(result) == i

// function inverse(r: Ref): Int
//   ensures address(result) == r

method test()
{
  inhale acc(address(3).val, 1/2)
  inhale acc(address(2).val, 1/2)
  inhale acc(address(1).val, 1/2)
  exhale forall i: Int :: 1 <= i <= 3 ==> acc(address(i).val, 1/2)
}
```

The expression `address(i)` implicitly defines a mapping between instances `i` of the quantifier and receiver references `address(i)`. Such receiver expressions cannot be fully-general: Viper imposes the restriction that this mapping must be provably *injective*: for any two instances of such a quantifier, the verifier must be able to prove that the corresponding receiver expressions are different. For us, this means proving `forall j: Int, k: Int :: j != k ==> address(j) != address(k)`. As usual, this condition can be proven using any information available at the particular program point. In addition, injectivity is only required for instances of the quantifier for which permission is actually required; in the above example, the restriction amounts to showing that the references `address(1)`, `address(2)` and `address(3)` are pairwise unequal. In the following exercises, this is illustrated more thoroughly.

//exercise//

* In the above example, try uncommenting the three lines after the `address` function declaration. The complaint about injectivity should then be removed, since the existence of an inverse function proves injectivity of `address`.
* Re-comment out the three lines (and check that the error re-occurs). In the example code above, try changing the permission <i>amounts</i> from `1/2` to `1/1` throughout. For example, change `acc(address(1).val,1/2)` to `acc(address(1).val, 1/1)` (or to `acc(address(1).val)`, which has the same meaning. This will remove the complaint about injectivity: the permissions held after the three `inhale` statements are sufficient to guarantee the required inequalities.
* A further alternative is to add instead an additional assumption (somewhere before the `exhale` statement):
 `inhale address(1) != address(2) && address(2) != address(3) && address(3) != address(1)`. Again, this should make the verifier happy; as also shown in the previous point, these inequalities are sufficient for the `exhale` to satisfy the injectivity restriction; there is no requirement for `address(i)` to be injective in general.
///

The injectivity restriction imposed by Viper has the consequence that, when considering permissions required via quantified permissions, one can equivalently think about these per instantiation of the quantified variable, or per corresponding instance of the receiver expression.
