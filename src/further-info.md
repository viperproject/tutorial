# More Information

For further information about the Viper project in general, please check out the [project page](http://viper.ethz.ch). This includes links to papers about the language, and about encoding a variety of verification problems into Viper. More examples to try online can be found [here](http://viper.ethz.ch/examples/). However, for more serious usage of Viper, we strongly recommend downloading a version to use locally, for example via our VSCode plugin. See the [project page](http://viper.ethz.ch) for more details.

If you have comments, questions or feedback about Viper, including this tutorial, we would be happy to receive them! Please send your emails to [viper@inf.ethz.ch](mailto:viper@inf.ethz.ch)
